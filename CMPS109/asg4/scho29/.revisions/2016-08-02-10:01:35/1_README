asg4-oop-inheritance

From the PDF that the professor provided:

In this assignment you will implement a simple graphics package using the OpenGL graphics library. Using inheritance, geometric objects will be displayed in a window. The lab workstations all run X11 so there is no problem there. When you log into the server remotely, be sure to specify the -X option, as in :
ssh -X username@unix.ucsc.edu
Before you log into the server make sure you have an X11 client running on your own workstation.

Personal Commentary:
All codes will work fine. This was the hardest assignment that I have ever done.
