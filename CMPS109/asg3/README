keyvalue
// Commentary:
   This assignment's main goal is to effectively manage a lined list of keys and values. In this assignment, everything should work as it is required by the assignment pdf. Instead of making it const on find() function, I decided to make it non-const. By doing this, a programmer is allowed to have more access than he/she needed from the find() function. Besides that everything else is working as it should be. 

These are from the assignment pdf that was given to us.
Usage:
   keyvalue [-@ flags] [filename...]

Within the files, input is read as any of the following:
   # [string]
      Any input line whose first non-whitespace character is a hash is ignored as a comment. This means that no key can begin with a hash. An empty line or a line consisting of nothing but white space is ignored. 
   
   key
      A line consting of at least one non-whotespace character and no equal sign causes the key and value pair to be printed. Prints out value found at corresponding key.
   
   key =
      If there is only whitespace after the equal sign, the key and value pair is deleted from the map. 
   
   key = value
      If the key is found in the map, its value field is replaced by the new value. If not found, the key an value are inserted in increasing lexicographic order, sorted by key. The new key and value pair is printed. 
   =
      All of the key and value pairs in the map are printed in lexicographic order. 
   
   = value
      All of the key and value pairs with the given value are printed in lexicographic order sorted by key.
