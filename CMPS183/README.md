# CMPS 183 - Fall 2016 #

This web application is dedicated to UCSC and Professor Luca de Alfaro for his CMPS 183 class. We initiated this project to redesign UCSC website and we are bringing a new kind of social networking website to the UC community. This website helps you to find information of UCSC such as classes, student-led organization, and many more. We are still working on progress and we are hoping to finish this project by the end of our graduation date.
