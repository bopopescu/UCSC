<ul>
  <li><strong>Self-Introduction:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>My name is Seongwoo Choi. I was born in South Korea and I grew up in Shanghai, China.<br> I was born on September 2nd 1994. I love the United States of America. This is the primary reason why I came to the USA. When I grow up, I want to work in Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>Especially when I saw a documentary about Silicon Valley, I was very excited that one place has all the information technology compnanies. I have not seen anywhere like this. How is this even possible? I think IT allows people to be united and moreover, it allows people to join together and have fun.</p>

  <li><strong>What is my intrigue?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="http://people.ucsc.edu/~scho29/public_html/Android%20Logo-395284.jpeg" alt="Android" width="578" height="277" /></p>
<p>I have not seen anything like Android Operating System. It is an open-source platform of which manufacturers can develop any smartphone based on their tastes. It was hard to think back the time before this was announced. I am also interested in developing Android application and iOS application by using HTML 5 and JavaScript. However, I do not have any skill to develop them. This comes to the reason why I am interested in Computer Science.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Why Computer Science?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>People have been asking me why I want to study Computer Science when I go to the university. The reason is simple. I wanted to study computer in detail. I think there is nothing like computers. I mean how can we live without using computers? It came into our lives so much that we cannot do anything about it. I think there are more possibilities we can work on this. I love computers. Everything what I am looking for is on the computers and on the websites.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dream</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I have a dream. I want to establish my own company in the USA and I want to live in Los Angeles with my parents for the rest of my life. This is what my parents want, too. I think I want to study computer languages and I want to contribute something to the USA and South Korea that there are more things we can do on the computers. Well, think about it. There is nothing that does not touch computers. Without computers, we cannot do many things. Definitely, this is a life changer.</p>

<p>I think developing more for the computer is good. We have indefinite possibilities on computers. This is the reason why I want to develop more on the computers. The University of California, Santa Cruz has the best computer science major in the United States of America. Definitely, attending this university will help me to find my career in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Future</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope I can become a successful entrepreneur in the future. I hope I can make a lot of innovations so that many people buy our products and also I want to get master degree on computer engineering in the future.</p>
<p>the end.</p>
