Professor Darrell Long

Introduction:

This assignment was for setting up freeBSD environment and writing a cat command on it. Git repository has to be on the operating system. This assgn0 is to write a cat command just like how we use cat on UNIX. 

Usage:
Please compile the cat.c by typing 'make'

An executable file will be created. 
Then, please type './cat' to start my cat program. 

For instance:

./cat File1 
this will read the content of File1 and print it if there is 'File1'.
