Assignment 2 Design Doc -- Lottery Scheduling

Team Members: 
Erik Andersen (Team Captain), Michael Cardoza, Yuzhuang Chen, Seongwoo Choi 

Seongwoo Choi: 
I was in charge of writing design doc and reorganizing the outline. I wrote 
how we should approach the project and then how we were going to divide our roles. 
I wrote two testing programs that check CPU process and Process ID. Moreover, I wrote
makefile, and readme for testing programs. README contains our team members' names and 
which programs we have been editing. 

Erik Andersen:
As a team captain of the project, he initialized adding users (team members) to his repository so
that everyone has a same repository and kernel to work on. He modified the kernel and he spent
a lot of time on the kernel modification. Erik added some new functions on the sched_ule.c 
and he was able to complete most of kernel modification. 

Yuzhuang Chen:
He was responsible for code editing and redefining some variables on the code. Later, Yuzhuang 
and I spent most of time working on design doc. 

Michael Cardoza:
Even though he joined our team late, he was able to contribute on modifying the testing programs that 
I have been working on and he integrated nice function into the read_test program which shows the nice
in the program.
